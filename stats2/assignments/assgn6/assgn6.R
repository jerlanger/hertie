# In a simple bivariate model, being a major donor is found to
# be an increase in 20.5% (0.2047) in similarity. This finding
# is statistically significant.
# This means that being a major donor essentially doubles the
# similarity between aid portfolios (ÃŸ0 being 0.2105)

# I do not believe that this is sufficient to indicate that being a "major donor"

# The size of staff has a large and positive effect on similarity. Moving

# reduced by almost half and the impact of individual organizations has much
